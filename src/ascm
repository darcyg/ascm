Usage:  %s <menu_file>

Format of menu file:
    * Comments (which beginning with a hash-sign) and empty lines are ignored.
    * First data line is name of menu.
    * All further lines ("data lines") define one menu item each.
    * Menu structure is given by the indentation of data lines.
    * Indentation is four spaces for one indentation level.
    * Each data line consists of a label and an optional command, separated by
      the command specifier '||x' (where x is a capital character).

Command specifiers:
    ||N   --> run command, do not wait after exit
    ||W   --> run command, wait for Enter after exit
    ||P   --> run command, pipe it to less pager
    ||B   --> run command in background

For the keyboard mapping, press '?'.
